# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## Fantasy Zoo Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling  in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings. 

### MVP

The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

### Project Extensions
 
* Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other. 
* Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
* Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left. 
* View the total income for the zoo.
* Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures


## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.
